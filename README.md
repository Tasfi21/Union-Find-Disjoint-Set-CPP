# Union-Find-Disjoint-Set-CPP
This repository contains an efficient implementation of the Disjoint Set Union (Union–Find) structure. Using path compression and union-by-rank, it supports fast merging and connectivity queries. Essential for Kruskal’s algorithm, clustering, and network connectivity problems.
